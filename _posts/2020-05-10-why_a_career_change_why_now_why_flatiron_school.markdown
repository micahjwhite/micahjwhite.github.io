I've worked for the same organization for almost nine years. It's a great place—mission-based, very established (434 years old!), and full of smart people who are trying to make a difference in the world. Oh, did I mention it has grand columns?

In 2011, I moved from Seoul, South Korea, where I had been teaching English for a few years, to New York. Not long after I arrived, I joined Oxford University Press (which is based in Oxford, UK, but has a branch in NYC) as an associate editor in the English Language Teaching division. I'm now a managing editor, and it's been a great ride. During my time in educational publishing, I've traveled the world—to Egypt, China, Turkey, and other fascinating places—to research the needs of English teachers and then, with my colleagues in NYC and the UK, work with authors, editors, designers, songwriters, video producers, and many more to create new courses for English language learners around the world. I learned a lot during these years. Market research? Check. Editorial and publishing workflows? Check. Author management? Project management? People management? Check, check, check. 

But now I'm a Full Stack Web Development student at Flatiron School. What happened? Quite a few things, actually. First, my interest in studying web development, particularly at Flatiron School, was piqued a few years ago when one of my colleagues left publishing to enroll at Flatiron. He loved it, landed a job (which he very much enjoys) as a full stack developer soon after graduating, and recently told me changing his career path was "the best decision he ever made." Secondly, as much as I've loved working in educational publishign for global English langauge learners, I've been feeling a little boxed in, both professionally and geographically. The higher you get in the publishing hiearchy, the fewer growth opportunities there are. And working in-house at a major publisher often requires you to live within commuting distance of NYC (which I do, although it's a *long* commute—two hours each way). I may want to move to Montana or Maine or Idaho one of these days (note: I want to live in all of those places), and the career path I had chosen was a very niche one that tied me to a particular place. I love the idea of developing a skill set that I can apply anywhere, should I choose to buy a farm in Wyoming one of these days. Lastly, I (and many others) am losing my job in July (maybe I should have led with that), as OUP has decided to close the NYC branch of the department I work for. I learned in January that this would be my fate, took a little time to think things through, and applied to Flatiron School. 

I'm now about six weeks into the self-paced online Full Stack Web Development program (I should have written this first blog post a while ago but time got away from me), wrapping up the Object Oriented Ruby section of the curriculum, and I couldn't be happier or more intellectually stimulated. In another day or two I'll be submitting my first project—a CLI Data Gem. I'm looking forward to writing about it, and much more, in the days ahead.
